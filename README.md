# Linux-Bash Scripts

Various scripts yeah idk man

change_mac -> Temporarily changes your MAC address.

restart_discord -> Cleans (ish) and restarts discord when it inevitably freezes in a voice call. I now just set my voice activity sensitivity to -100dB so my green circle doesn't go in and out anymore but this is still sometimes useful.

goliveaudio -> Sets up virtual sinks and loopbacks in order to be able to share computer audio to discord. Naturally EVERYONE has to hear it but ehhhh they'll live.

create_playlist -> Creates a m3u playlist relative to a folder of music. Getting the filenames to properly print was a much bigger pain in the ass than it needed to be. Oh well.
