# Linux Bash Scripts

## Various Bash scripts I've made, ranging from useful to... fun!

change_mac
: Temporarily changes your MAC address.

restart_discord
: Cleans (ish) and restarts discord when it inevitably freezes in a voice call. I now just set my voice activity sensitivity to -100dB so my green circle doesn't go in and out anymore but this is still sometimes useful.

discord_share_sound
: Sets up virtual sinks and loopbacks in order to be able to share computer audio to discord. Naturally EVERYONE has to hear it but ehhhh they'll live.

create_playlist
: Creates a m3u playlist relative to a folder of music. Getting the filenames to properly print was a much bigger pain in the ass than it needed to be. Oh well.

ciphers
: Some ciphers I thought were cool and decided to write in Bash of all things...
